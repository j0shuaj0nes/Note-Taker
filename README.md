# Note-Taker

## Description
A Note Taker application that can be used to write and save notes.
This project taught me how to create connections between front and back end of an application. 
This app allows users to note down ideas, appointments, shopping lists, etc and save them in one location to be able to access them at a later point in time. 

## Usage
To use this app, first click on the 'Get started' button. 
See below:

Next, click in the 'Note Title' field to enter the title of your note. Then click in the 'Note Text' feild to enter the body of your note.

Once you are happy with the note you have entered, click 'save note' and the note will save and appear in the list of notes to the left of the screen. If you have made a mess of your note entry and want to start again, click 'clear form', and the field will revert to a blank.
